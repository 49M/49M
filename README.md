## Hello world!

My name is Michal, I study Computer Science at UofT and build startups/projects on the side. 
I'm interested in all things AI, Full-Stack and Data Science.
Software has the ability to simplify complex processes, help people connect, help create breakthroughs across all industries, and so much more. I want to be on the frontlines of that innovation.
