## Hello world!

Hi, I'm Michal, I study Computer Science at UofT and am passionate about building startups and side projects. 
I’m especially interested in AI, full-stack development, and data science.

I believe software can simplify complexity, connect people, and drive innovation across industries. I’m excited to be on the frontlines of that transformation.

- 🔭 I’m working on: Developian (Transforming visions to goals to realities with AI)
- 🌱 I’m learning: LangGraph and Using Vector Databases
- 💬 Ask me about: Full-Stack Development, OOP Design, and Data Structures & Algorithms
