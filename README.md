## Hello world!

Hi, I'm Michal, I study Computer Science at UofT and am passionate about building startups and side projects. 
Iâ€™m especially interested in AI, full-stack development, and data science.

I believe software can simplify complexity, connect people, and drive innovation across industries. Iâ€™m excited to be on the frontlines of that transformation.
